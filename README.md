### 🧠 What is PayFlow?

PayFlow AI Spark is a frontend-first payment layer designed for devs who want to:

- Accept payments via **Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Crypto** – no Stripe needed
- Keep **full control of your backend + keys**
- Avoid monthly fees, vendor lock-in, or compliance bloat
- Run light, fast, mobile-native payment flows

Works beautifully with your own backend, or integrate with the free backend we provide below.

### 🚀 Who's It For?

✅ Indie devs  
✅ App builders using Flutter/React Native/Android/iOS
